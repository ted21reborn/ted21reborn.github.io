> ### 语音作业（必做）

今天主要练习连读（位置：3:20），这哥们儿都连读成这样了，大家抄家伙赶上 。不认识的单词一定要查带发音的字典。

>So if I ask you to access a memory, like, what is that? What just happened? Do you have a wallet? Do you have an American Express in your wallet? And when I do that, your Frank turns around. He accesses the file. He has to rewind the tape. What's interesting is, he can't rewind the tape at the same time that he's trying to process new data.

>This sounds like a good theory - I can talk for a long time, tell you lots of things, and they may be true, a portion of them, but I think it's better if I tried to show that to you here live. So, if I come down, I'm going to do a bit of shopping. Just hold still where you are.
